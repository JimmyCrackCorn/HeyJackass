Yay!! Only hundreds murdered and thousands maimed!! Yay!! Anyway, the <a href="http://homicides.suntimes.com/2013/12/28/progress-not-success-chicago-tallies-fewest-murders-since-1965/">Sun-times says</a>:</p>
<p><i style="color:#fff">&#8220;Despite averaging 1.1 murders a day, Chicago Police reported a 17 percent decrease in killings from 2012 and the fewest murders in the city since 1965. But McCarthy isn’t celebrating. “This is progress, not success,” he said, “We still have way too much gun violence in this city.”&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Of course that&#8217;s complete bullshit, but it&#8217;s an absolutely perfect headline for those not paying attention. If one were to read beyond the headline, the same article says:</p>
<p><i style="color:#fff">&#8220;The Cook County medical examiner’s office reported 443 homicides as of Friday, including 13 police-involved shootings, three killings on expressways investigated by Illinois State Police and other deaths that Chicago Police either ruled justified or remain under investigation.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And there folks is your real number which just so happens to coincide with our number. </p>
<p>1965 our collective asses. May as well have said 1765 when Chicago was nothing more than swampland inhabited by some Indians&#8230; or Native Americans for you PC&#8217;ers. </p>

<p>Recall our <a href="http://www.heyjackass.com/enlightening-commentary/stuck-on-stupid/" title="Stuck on Stupid">&#8220;Stuck on Stupid&#8221; post</a> where a local dumbass, er, politician accused the CPD of killing kids: <i style="color:#fff">&#8220;There&#8217;s some suspicion &#8211; and I don&#8217;t want to spread this, but I&#8217;m just going to tell you what I&#8217;ve been hearing &#8211; they suspect maybe the police are killing some of these kids.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Who could forget <a href="http://www.heyjackass.com/enlightening-commentary/i-have-a-gun-in-my-ass/" title="“I have a gun in my ass”">Kreepy, the gun in the ass guy</a>: <i style="color:#fff">&#8220;A Little Village gang member is being held on $20,000 bail after he admitted to police he was hiding a loaded gun in his buttocks, authorities said. &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna be real with you, I have a gun in my ass&#8230;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s our original <a href="http://www.heyjackass.com/enlightening-commentary/honor-student-of-the-week/" title="Honor Student of the Week">Honor Student of the Week</a> who still happens to be on life support: <i style="color:#fff">&#8220;Back in June, honor student, productive citizen and all around good guy, Antonio Lewis, &#8220;allegedly&#8221; shot and killed a five year old and his mother in their New City neighborhood home. He also attempted to kill the 11 year old brother too but his gun jammed.&#8221;</i> </p>

<p>While Sandy Hook was no doubt a horrific event and one that should never be repeated, events like those are rare. What is far from rare is that every single day minority, mostly black children and young adults, kill one another with wanton abandon on the south and west sides of Chicago.</p>
<p>In the one year since Sandy Hook, Chicago has seen 441 people murdered (~17 Sandy Hooks) and at least another 1,800 have been shot and wounded. Of the 441, 58 children (17 and under) have been murdered since then. Aside from maybe one or two high profile, politically expedient cases, can anyone name much less recall any of the events of the 2,200+? Nope.  </p>
<p>The only difference here is that one is considered a tragedy and the literally thousands of others are statistics.    </p>

<p>But after cops and paramedics arrived, Zajac went into fight mode and began attacking them, police said.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And again, f*ck you, save your own sorry drunk ass. </p>

<p>Not too bad. We were over on one and under on the other with November tallying 27 homicides and an additional 111 shot and wounded. Despite the January like temps towards the end of the month, the lead kept flying. &#8216;A &#8216;for effort fellas.   </p>
<p>The 27 homicides by the numbers: </p>
<ul>
<li>22 males</li>
<li>5 females</li>
<li>23 (85%) shot</li>
<li>3 (11%) stabbed</li>
<li>27 average age</li>
<li>5 teenagers</li>
<li>12 under age 25</li>
<li>9 shot in the head</li>
<li>11 shot in the torso</li>
<li>17.2% shot-to-kill ratio</li>
<li>0 police involved (yay.)</li>
<li>17 different neighborhoods</li>
<li>6 for Team Englewood</li>
<li>1 double homicide</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking ahead to December, we&#8217;re going to forecast 30 (+/-3) homicides and 90 (+/-10) shot and wounded. We&#8217;ll wrap up the year just shy of 440 total homicides and around 1,750 shot and wounded.  </p>

Thank you. </p>
<p>A somewhat quiet weekend is leading into a wintery week where we&#8217;ll likely see less violence and stupidity than usual. The weekend ended with no one killed and 11 wounded.  </p>
<p>In other news, one of <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-police-woman-28-accused-of-beating-man-82-after-accident-20131110,0,5868086.story">Chatham&#8217;s finest decided to beat the crap out of an old man</a>:</p>
<p><i style="color:#fff">&#8220;A 28-year-old Chicago woman is being held on $2 million bail after being accused of dragging an 82-year-old man out of his car and beating him after a traffic accident Thursday night on the South Side, police said.</p>
<p>The victim told officers he was driving westbound when he was &#8220;flagged down&#8221; by two unknown females, police said. The man said after he parked to help them, he was &#8220;pulled out&#8221; of the vehicle and struck in the head and body several times by the women, police said. Some of the injuries were caused by a screwdriver.</p>
<p>A police investigation determined that after the victim accidentally bumped one of the women with his vehicle, Body said on the scene: <strong>&#8220;Yeah, I pulled his ass out of the car and beat the fuck out of him,&#8221;</strong> according to a police report.&#8221;</i> </p>
<p>So much for respecting your elders. Despite the $2 million bail, we expect to see our foul-mouthed &#8220;good kid&#8221;, &#8220;wonderful mother&#8221; and &#8220;pillar of the community&#8221; who was &#8220;just turning her life around&#8221; to be back on the streets in no time.  </p>

One could understand the anger and angst amongst the residences over shootings, homicides, crime and poverty, but instead <a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20131106/englewood/residents-urge-boycott-of-englewood-gas-station-with-makeshift-signage" target="_blank">some have pointed their anger towards a sign</a>:</p>
<p><i style="color:#fff">&#8220;Calling it &#8220;disrespectful,&#8221; a neighborhood group is protesting the lack of enough signs at K&#038;D Fuel at 6700 S. Ashland Ave.</p>
<p>Members of the Resident Association of Greater Englewood passed out fliers to customers earlier this week to show their frustration and to encourage them to boycott the gas station, which has been open for about a year.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>As if there isn&#8217;t enough shuttered storefronts in that neighborhood already. </p>
<p><i style="color:#fff">&#8220;By not having better signs and &#8220;simply putting up a sign [the owner] made is disrespectful to the community,&#8221; Cunningham said. &#8220;He thinks he can treat us any way he wants because this is Englewood, but he is wrong.&#8221;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Good grief. There have been a number of murders just blocks from this station so far this year and the complaint is about a stupid sign. Well, at least one guy gets it:</p>
<p><i style="color:#fff">&#8220;I could give a flying you know what when it comes to who supplies the gas,&#8221; customer Jamal Funches said. &#8220;As long as it is cheap, I&#8217;m good.&#8221;</i> </p>

<ul>
<li>31 males</li>
<li>3 females</li>
<li>29 (85%) shot</li>
<li>4 (12%) stabbed</li>

<li>3 police involved</li>
<li>19 different neighborhoods</li>
<li>1 triple homicide</li>

Last year it was announced that the CPD would start issuing tickets for marijuana use/possession instead of  the usual arrest, trial, and all of that. The idea was it was not only going to save money, but generate lots of revenue. <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/23331575-761/one-year-after-decriminalization-pot-tickets-a-bust.html" target="_blank">As usual, it didn&#8217;t happen that way:</a>   </p>
<p><i style="color:#fff">&#8220;Chicago Police issued just 1,117 tickets for small amounts of marijuana in the first 14 months of decriminalization — and the cash-strapped city has collected only 21 percent of the $310,755 in fines, records show.&#8221; </i></p>
<p>21% of $310,755 is $67,256. Estimated revenue for the first year, $1 million, easy. Whoops. </p>
<p><i style="color:#fff">&#8220;The mayor’s office didn’t respond to questions about the low collection rate for fines. But historically, the city has had a tough time collecting for similar administrative fines ranging from loud noise to fly dumping. In the case of pot tickets, the person may be thumbing their nose at the fine or doesn’t have the wherewithal to pay it.</i></p>
<p>Yet, somehow, the mayor expects to collect millions and millions from speed and red light cameras. We&#8217;re betting we&#8217;ll see the same shortfall here as well, dude. </p>

<p><i style="color:#fff">&#8220;Daley is one of several former city officials who have given sworn, pretrial testimony in Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s 2-year-old lawsuit to break the “sweetheart” deal that Daley relatives, friends and associates got in 2003 to operate the restaurant for 30 years.</p>
<p>Emanuel&#8217;s lawsuit says the &#8220;commercially unreasonable&#8221; deal has cost taxpayers more than $5 million because it gives Park Grill free natural gas, water and garbage collection while the restaurant on Michigan Avenue has paid the park district just $2.6 million from January 2004 through last July.</p>
<p>In his deposition, Daley says he doesn’t recall whether clout helped the Park Grill&#8217;s investors — including his cousin Theresa Mintle, who was Emanuel’s first chief of staff — win the restaurant deal over two other bidders, one of them a group that included venture capitalist Bruce Rauner, an Emanuel friend now running for governor.</i></p>
<p>Insiders, cronies and sweetheart deals all at taxpayer expense. Plus it&#8217;s also good to see the leading Republican candidate for governor, Bruce Rauner, named here as well because it just wouldn&#8217;t be Illinois without equal opportunity crony capitalism.  </p>

<li>1 Female</li>
<li>25.2yo average age</li>
<li>All in their 20s</li>
<li>2 shot in the ass</li>

<p><i style="color:#fff">&#8220;New data show Chicago&#8217;s nascent speed camera system is already lightening the city’s lead feet, but the numbers are also prompting critics to wonder whether City Hall is in for a massive revenue windfall at taxpayers’ expense.&#8221;</p>

<p><i style="color:#fff">&#8220;Since the school year began, city workers from various departments have been pulled from their regular duties for a few hours a day to monitor Safe Passage routes throughout the city. Now, some residents and aldermen are complaining about gaps in city services due to the workers being pulled from their wards.</p>
<p>Ald. Scott Waguespack (32nd)… said he has gotten more complaints from residents in south Lakeview about tree debris sitting &#8220;for weeks on end&#8221; and delays in ordinance violation ticketing and rat calls… building inspections have been taking longer than usual because inspectors have been diverted to Safe Passage routes…&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Wait, what? Building inspectors are assigned to monitor Safe Passage routes? Now there&#8217;s a real efficient use of taxpayer time and money. </p>
<p>At least there won&#8217;t be a problem as long as those signs are present. </p>

<p>We&#8217;ve always assumed that being a CFD paramedic wasn&#8217;t the most glamorous job in the world and one has to put up with a lot of shit (literally and figuratively).  What we didn&#8217;t realize was the crazy amount of violence they have to put up with on a daily basis. </p>
<p><i style="color:#fff">&#8220;Chicago emergency personnel are being assaulted on the job and first responders say it&#8217;s getting worse.</p>
<p>You could hardly blame paramedics if they felt some paranoia on every call. First responders tell the I-Team that at least once a day in the City of Chicago, paramedics trying to save lives, end up fighting to stay alive.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>At least once a day?! WTF?</p>
<p>Our proposal is simple, if these individuals, families, groups, blocks and/or neighborhoods want to beat on some defenseless EMTs that were called in to save you ass, f*ck you and drive your own sorry, drunk, high, lead poisoned ass to the hospital. And while you&#8217;re there, pick up your own tab instead of passing it onto others.    </p>

<p>Not only was ol&#8217; Kev already on felony probation, he had a pending robbery case (another felony). Now add yet a couple more felonies to the mix and maybe he&#8217;ll get some jail time. </p>

<p>The 21-year-old Blackstones gang member had been shot in the leg Thursday by a rival gang member, and instead of reporting the shooting to police, he went looking to retaliate, authorities said.</p>
<p>Armed with an assault rifle and joined by several of his friends, Champ went to Cornell Square Park on Thursday night with one goal in mind: to shoot any Gangster Disciples in sight, authorities said.&#8221; </i></p>
<p>And there you have it. &#8220;Mythical&#8221; gangbangers engaged in their asinine circle jerk of violence, stupidity and poor aim. This is nothing new other than the number of shot and the same story has been written thousands of times over the past 40+ years. </p>
<p>Since the time of this shooting, eight (8) have been killed and another 31 have been wounded. That&#8217;s 3x this one incident but chances are unless you&#8217;re paying attention no one has taken much notice nor likely much cares. </p>

<p>PS &#8211; Prediction: another mass shooting incident like this comprised of at least 6 shot will occur here in the next 6 months. </p>

<p>But when looking at murder rate, smaller cities like Flint or Detroit (obviously) are much more violent. </p>
<p><i style="color:#fff">&#8220;But residents of Chicago and New York were much less likely to be victims of a homicide than residents of Flint, Mich. Sixty-three murders occurred in 2012 in Flint, a city of 101,632, meaning one in every 1,613 city residents were homicide victims. Detroit, which experienced 386 homicides in 2012, was almost as unsafe; that’s enough murders to account for one in every 1,832 residents.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>We wonder if the FBI has a Stanley Cup-like trophy that gets passed around from city to city each year. If so, we propose calling it the Coroner Cup. Can&#8217;t wait for that parade.</p>

<p>The latest hit comes from CBS2 who has discovered that <a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2013/09/10/2-investigators-safe-passage-routes-lead-kids-past-sex-offender-shelters/" target="_blank">two of the routes have &#8220;children walk right by shelters with sex offenders&#8221;</a>. </p>
<p><i style="color:#fff">&#8220;On the outside, an old church building appears safe. Children walk by it to go along a safe passage route to school. But this church is also a shelter for child sex offenders. Predators targeting the youngest of victims which worries parents like Lisa Jones.</p>
<p>CBS 2 found 65 child sex offenders registered at this shelter, yet Chicago Public School officials decided to start safe passage route on the same street.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>At least there won&#8217;t be a problem as long as those signs are present. </p>
<p>And in other Safe Passage news, a <a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20130911/east-garfield-park/man-caught-selling-shotgun-shells-on-safe-passage-route-court-records" target="_blank">local entrepreneur thought the shotgun shell market was underserved on the routes</a>.</p>
<p><i style="color:#fff">&#8220;A man busted for selling shotgun shells along a Safe Passage route in East Garfield Park allegedly told police that he wanted $3 per box but &#8220;ain&#8217;t no one want to buy them.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>$3 per box is pretty cheap but he clearly doesn&#8217;t understand that the market is for 9mm not shotgun shells. </p>

<p>Remind us again which one is considered a war zone and the recipient of billions and billions of taxpayer of dollars in military funding and support? </p>
<p>Also of note, 2,259 US troops have been killed in Afghanistan since Jan 1, 2002 vs 5,473 murdered in Chicago. And the entire Iraq war (2003-2012)? 4,486. Again, remind us… </p>

The idea that some signs, yellow vests and massive amounts of police and fire overtime will do anything besides bring out some TV news cameras is laughable. </p>
<p>Now comes word that just one week into the school year <a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2013/09/03/one-week-in-safe-passage-workers-quit-corners-not-covered/" target="_blank">many workers have already quit</a>:</p>
<p><i style="color:#fff">&#8220;Just over a week into the new school year, CBS 2 has discovered some serious problems with the safe passage program, including street corners that are uncovered and, in one case, massive turnover of safe passage workers.</p>
<p>In one case in the Roseland neighborhood, half the safe passage workers quit last week alone.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, there were no safe passage workers at a designated spot at 119th and State streets.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Some reasons for the turnover: </p>
<p><i style="color:#fff">“Last week was a very hot week,” he said. “A lot of people have health issues and were not ready to be out in the sun.” and &#8220;Supervisors say others find full-time, better paying jobs.&#8221; </i></p>
<p>So on one side we have people with health issues and on the other people who&#8217;ve all of a sudden found full time jobs in a part time economy. Bullshit! We&#8217;re going with the time tested excuses of laziness, boredom and apathy. </p>

<p>From Friday afternoon through early morning Tuesday there were a total of 11 homicides and another 27 shot and wounded. Last year there were just 4 homicides whereas 2011 saw 10. </p>
<p>Labor Day weekend by the numbers: </p>
<ul>
<li>11 dead</li>
<li>27 wounded</li>
<li>36 were male</li>
<li>2 were female</li>
<li>23.6 average age</li>
<li>11 teenagers</li>
<li>27 <= 25 years old</li>
<li>26% shot-to-kill ratio</li>
<li>2 police involved shootings</li>
<li>21 different neighborhoods</li>
</ul>
<p>Well at least it wasn&#8217;t as bad as the 4th of July weekend. Success!</p>
<p>Also, September is off to a hell of a start with 5 homicides and another 17 shot and wounded. </p>

If not, back in June, Antonio &#8220;allegedly&#8221; shot and killed a five year old and his mother in their New City neighborhood home. He also attempted to kill the 11 year old brother too but his gun jammed. </p>
<p>Antonio is back in the news again, this time because he&#8217;s being <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-sterling-sims-chavonne-brown-killed-antonio-lewis-third-murder-charge-20130830,0,1870561.story" target="_blank">tagged with another murder charge</a>:</p>
<p><i style="color:#fff">&#8220;Antonio Lewis, of the 5500 block of South Winchester Avenue, was charged with first-degree murder on Thursday in connection with the shooting death of 30-year-old Brandon Johnson on Halloween last year.</p>
<p>Police said Johnson may have been conducting a “narcotics transaction” when he opened the door of his apartment, in the 5400 block of South Wolcott Avenue, and Lewis shot him.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>That&#8217;s quite a rap sheet for an 18 year old.  But, don&#8217;t forget, <a href="http://www.heyjackass.com/enlightening-commentary/honor-students-of-the-week/" title="Honor Student(s) of the Week">his buddy tried to have him killed a day after the double homicide</a>. That said&#8230;</p>
<p><i style="color:#fff">&#8220;Lewis isn’t scheduled to appear in bond on the third murder charge, in the death of Johnson, because he’s still hospitalized.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Bummer. Get well soon Antonio.  </p>
