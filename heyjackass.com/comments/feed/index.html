		<description><![CDATA[Definitely need improved ratio of KIA to WIA. I&#039;d say if the HS can reach 100-200 KIA per month we might make a dent in the monkey population. I wonder what caliber they use, because there are so many surviors. Maybe bad ammo too? RN instead of HP? Any stats on that anywhere? Would be interesting to see.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The real &quot;list&quot; is probably closer 13,000 and not the measly 1,300 that the Administration continuously refers to in these briefings. The problem is that they can&#039;t possibly come out and tell us that there are 10,000 - 15,000 ready and willing killers running around on our streets because that would cause a panic.

Let&#039;s just keep telling them that it&#039;s only about one thousand bad guys...They&#039;ll be able to stomach that...it&#039;s a manageable number and a task that can be achieved. Let&#039;s also tell them that the victims are on the list as well, that way they&#039;ll feel like they&#039;re isolated.

Meanwhile, we have already reached 1,300 people shot this year. If 80% of the victims on the list, then the list should be down to 250. I think the list dropped from 13,000 to 12,000 and will make a big jump next month +2,000 to +3,000 when school gets out.]]></description>
